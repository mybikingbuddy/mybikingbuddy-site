          Lifted legs hard yesterday. Gym was freezing and hard to breathe.
          Aiming for 500kJ but legs were cooked.

          Pushing 243 watts for thirty minutes on fatigued legs in a freezing environment
          is a testament to your discipline. While you missed your 500kJ target,
          the output remains high given the restricted breathing and prior leg work.
          Accept the 437kJ as a survival metric under these conditions,
          but do not let falling short of your standard become a habit.
