            Lifted legs hard yesterday. Gym was freezing and hard to breathe.
            Aiming for 500kJ but legs were cooked.

            Pushing 243 watts for thirty minutes on fatigued legs in a freezing
            environment is a testament to your discipline. While you missed your
            500kJ target, the output remains high given the restricted breathing
            and prior leg work. Accept the 437kJ as a survival metric under these
            conditions, but do not let falling short of your standard become a habit.
